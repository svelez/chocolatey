Features
--------
 * Conceptual Design - Explore design ideas and create organic shapes with T-Splines push-pull commands.
 * 3D Surface &amp; Solid Modeling - Create functional models with flexible real-time direct solid modeling and feature-based solid modeling complete with assembly tools.
 * History Based Modeling - Track and make changes to your design using your design timeline, as edits are made the model automatically updates to reflect the changes.
 * Model from Scanned Designs - Import OBJ or STL bodies as mesh models and easily create custom designs with object snapping to the mesh surface.
 * 3D Printing - Prepare your designs for 3D printing with Autodesk Meshmixer within Fusion 360. Preview the mesh structure, make pre-print refinements, and never use another 3D print utility again.
 * Assembly &amp; Motion Studies - Assemble components. Create relationships, animate &amp; simulate motion, and review the fit and function of your design.
 * Form Inspection &amp; Analysis - Validate the quality of your model with curvature comb analysis, zebra analysis, draft analysis, curvature mapping, interference checking, assembly motion studies and more.
 * File Translation, Import &amp; Export - Import and export design files with unlimited CAD translation. Fusion 360 supports translation of over 50 different file types, including .OBJ, .DXF, .DWG, .SLDPRT and .PDF.
